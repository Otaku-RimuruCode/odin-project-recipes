  <p>Caprese salad meets sauteed zucchini noodles in this super easy dish filled with basil, tomatoes,<br>
     and gooey cheese. Make sure all your ingredients are ready to go, because this will be ready fast. <br>

      <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cherry tomatoes and <br>
