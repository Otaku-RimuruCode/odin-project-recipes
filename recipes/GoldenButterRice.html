       <h2>Golden Butter Rice</h2>
       <p>This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice. <br>
         It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it really is rice cooked in butter. <br>
        This is my favorite version, with seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>2 cups basmati rice or other long grain white rice</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Step 1</h4>Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. <br> As soon as butter starts to bubble, add in ginger, <br>
                 turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar, and salt. Cook, whisking, for 1 minute.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 2</h4>Add rice, and stir until every grain is coated with butter. <br>
                 Stir in water, and bring to a boil over high heat. <br> As soon as it begins to boil, 
                 gently shake and swirl the pan to settle rice into an even layer,
                  <br> then reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 3</h4>Cover tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. <br>
                 Turn off heat, and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. <br>
                  DO NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet.</li>
            <li><h4>step 4</h4>Now, remove the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains. <br>
                 Season to taste, and serve immediately, garnished with walnuts and green onions.</li>
        </ol>
